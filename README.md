# Markblog 📖
The way to blog with markdown. 

## Vision 👁‍🗨
I want to write a blog. I also want to write using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), in my own environment. 
There are ways to do this. However, I did not find anything 
that was as simple and "plug-and-play"-like as I wanted. 

This need is what I want _Markblog_ to fix for me.
