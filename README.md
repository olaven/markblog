## About 
Markblog is a small `cli` that converts markdown files into a lightweight blog. 
It is not tied to any platform, and you own your files. In other words, you are the only one owning your content. 
Markblog aims to be easy to use and uncomplicated.

## Installation 
* Install [deno](deno.land)
* `deno install --allow-read --allow-write markblog https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olaven/markblog/master/markblog.ts`
* Update your path like the installation tells you to

## Getting started
* Run `markblog init` in an empty folder.
* Write posts in the generated `./posts`, in `.md`-files.

### Options 
Options enable you to specify where Markblog should look for files 
when generating your blog. There are default settings, and specifying 
custom options can be emitted entirely. If however, you want to use custom options, a `.json`-file must be provided,
with `--options path/to/options.json`. The file has to be formatted in 
the following way: 
```json
{
    "post_source": "./my_posts", 
    "post_destination": "./my_destination", 
    "post_style": "../post_style.css",
    "index_style": "./index_style.css", 
}
```
