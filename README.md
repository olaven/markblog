## Idea 👁‍🗨
I want to write a blog. I also want to write using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), in my own environment. 
There are ways to do this. However, I did not find anything 
that was as simple and "plug-and-play"-like as I wanted. 

This need is what I want _Markblog_ to fix for me. 

## Setup
You only need three things: 
1. ./index.md, for writing content of the front page. 
2. ./posts, containing files for each post.
3. ./style.css
